  "summary": "A wealth-building approach that involves refinancing a stabilized property after value-add improvements to extract equity while maintaining ownership, allowing investors to recover capital while continuing to benefit from cash flow and appreciation.",
  "key_points": [
    "Time refinance after property stabilization when improvements are fully reflected in NOI",
    "Target 70-75% loan-to-value to extract maximum equity while maintaining positive cash flow",
    "Ensure debt service coverage ratio remains at 1.25 or higher after refinancing",
    "Consider longer amortization periods to maximize cash flow",
    "Evaluate tax implications of cash-out refinancing versus selling",
    "Analyze whether extracted capital deployed elsewhere would outperform continued ownership",
    "Maintain reserves even after refinancing to protect against market fluctuations"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Purchasing a property for $1M with $250K down, adding $200K in improvements that increase value to $1.8M, then refinancing at 75% LTV to extract $350K while maintaining ownership",
    "Using extracted capital as down payment on next acquisition while original property continues generating cash flow",
    "Refinancing after 3-5 years when value-add improvements have matured and market has appreciated"
